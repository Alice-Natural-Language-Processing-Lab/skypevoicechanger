**For Developers:**
Skype Voice Changer demonstrates how to use NAudio and Skype4COM to allow real-time effects processing of your voice during a Skype
conversation. It is developed in C#. It was initially developed to accompany [Mark Heath's](https://markheath.net) Coding4Fun
article: [Skype Voice Changer](http://blogs.msdn.com/coding4fun/archive/2009/02/02/9391048.aspx). It demonstrates the use
of [NAudio](https://github.com/naudio/NAudio/) for audio playback and sample manipulation. Eventually, it is intended that the 
effects framework in this project will become part of the core NAudio library.
